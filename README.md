This software was created by me (Éverson Filipe) as a micro-system built with Python and Streamlit. You input your information, and the system generates fully compliant PDFs or DOCX files optimized for readability by SEO, LLMO, and especially ATS algorithms. It also allows you to create article prototypes optimized for ABNT standards, etc.
